# C++20 Modules

This repository demonstrates how to use the C++20 modules feature with CMake v3.26 as the build system and  CLang v16 as the compiler.

Run `make run` to run the project.

> I couldn't figure out how to get autocompletions in VSCode for C++ modules. I tried both Microsoft C/C++ extension and LLVM CLangD extension.
